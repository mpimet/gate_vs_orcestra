## GATE vs ORCESTRA

This repo contains the files to compare the measurements (mostly soundings) from GATE to ORCESTRA. 

The GATE campaign is desribed in Kuettner (1974) and on the [GATE-website](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/gate). 
The ORCESTRA campaign is described on [this website](https://orcestra-campaign.org/intro.html), and ORCESTRA data can be found using the [Data Browser](https://browser.orcestra-campaign.org/#/?s=).

American Meteorological Society, 55, 526â€“530, 1974.

### Accessing the Data

Most of the scripts in this repo use data that is puplicly available on [IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/). To obtain data from the IPFS network, you need access to an [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway).

We recommend that you use your own local gateway for faster access and local caching.
The simplest solution is to install [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/), which provides a graphical user interface and runs a [Kubo daemon](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) in the background.

If you are **unable** to install software on your machine (e.g. work laptop), you can configure IPFS to use the public HTTPS gateway by setting:

```
export IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io
```

To then access the data using Python, you will need to install the [`ipfsspec>=0.6.0`](http://pypi.org/project/ipfsspec/) package.
It is essential to install `ipfsspec` using pip, the version provided via `conda-forge` is outdated and **broken**.

### Running the scripts in this repo

The python environment for this repo was build using [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv). All dependencies  can be found in the `pyproject.toml`, in case you want to build your own environment.

Although most of the (plotting) scripts can be run with this environment, there are a few special cases that are described below.
=======


### Using PAMTRA for the sondes

To use the pamtra model, it has to be installed separately from the uv environment. On levante, the following steps suffice to do that, if run from within the repo.

```
module load git
module load netcdf-c
module load fftw
module load gcc
spack load /tpmfvwu # openblas

CC=gcc uv run pip install git+https://github.com/igmk/pamtra
``` 

On a MAC, 
```
brew install openblas pkgconf netcdf fftw gcc@14
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"
CC=gcc-14 uv run pip install git+https://github.com/igmk/pamtra
```
Other gcc versions can also be used, however, they apparently have to be smaller than 15. 

### Running konrad

Konrad relies on the CliMT package, which unfortunately is no longer maintained.
Consequently, installation with `uv` is not possible right away.
However, the following workaround should install Konrad and CliMT to the virtual environment:

```
# Activate the `uv` environment directly
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set environment variables for C anf Fortran compilers
export CC=gcc-12
export FC=gfortran-12

# Set the target architecture (different for Apple M1 [arm64])
[[ $(uname -p) == arm64 ]] && export TARGET=ARMV8 || export TARGET=HASWELL

# Install a trimmed down version of CliMT that ships RRTMG only
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/atmtools/climt@rrtmg-only

# Install konrad itself
python3 -m pip install konrad
```

It should then be possible to run `uv run gate_vs_orcestra/rce_simulation.py`.


### Re-Creating the high Level radiosonde datasets

For consistency, the GATE Level 1 files as well as the RAPSODI Level 1 data are processed with [pydropsonde (version >= 0.5.1)](https://github.com/atmdrops/pydropsonde). To use this processing tool  entering: 
```
uv add pydropsonde
```
should be sufficient to run the `pydropsonde4gate.py` and the `reprocess_rapsodi.py` scripts to reproduce the data used in this repo.
